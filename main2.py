"""
Step 1: Initialize Main Script and Load Libraries
    - Aim: Create a main script and ensure all necessary libraries and dependencies are imported.

Step 2: Load Site Data
    - Aim: Utilize `siteToBlocks.py` to import the LiDAR scan data of the urban environment. Process the data as needed for it to be inserted into the Octree structure.

Step 3: Initialize Custom Octree
    - Aim: Create an instance of the CustomOctree class. Initialize it with a root node covering the spatial bounds of the entire dataset. Also, initialize an empty dictionary for storing block information.

Step 4: Insert Site Data into Octree as Blocks
    - Aim: Use the site data loaded from `siteToBlocks.py` to insert points into the Octree. During insertion, assign each point to appropriate blocks such as Building Block, Ground Block, etc. based on their attributes. Store block-level information in the block dictionary initialized earlier.

Step 5: Further Processing of Blocks (Tree Blocks)
    - Aim: Add or refine blocks, with a focus on Tree Blocks. This can include further subdivision, attribute assignment, or association with Octree nodes.

Step 6: Voxelization of Octree
    - Aim: Traverse the Octree to its leaf nodes and create a point cloud from the center points of these leaf nodes. Convert this point cloud into a voxel grid for visualization purposes.

Step 7: Generate Bounding Boxes for Visualization
    - Aim: Traverse the Octree to generate bounding boxes for Octree nodes. Assign colors to each bounding box based on the node's dominant attribute and prepare these for visualization.

Step 8: Visualize Octree and Blocks
    - Aim: Utilize the OctreeVisualizer class to create a 3D visualization of the Octree. Add the voxel grid and bounding boxes to the visualization. Enable interaction with keyboard callbacks for exploration of the 3D model.
